Final Project: Food By Culture 
===
Team: Aura Velarde & Erik Sola

Food sourrounds us everywhere. It's a necessity that has become engrained deeply into our lives. From a social experience, to cultural celebrations, food has taken a more significant meaning in our lives than fuel to survive.

In this project, our main goal was to explore the different types of cultures in different cities, compare the top 40 restaurants in the area in a cultural aspect, and explore the locations of said restaurants. We wanted to start hypothesizing
wether there could be bias in the top 40 restaurants because of the predominant culture, and locations.

Feel free to explore and think critically about what you see.
